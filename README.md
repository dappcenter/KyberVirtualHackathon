# KyberVirtualHackathon

The application is being built on the website of [ETH Savings Strategy Cards](https://strategy-cards.carrd.co/)

There exists a scripts folder that contains all the scripts being written currently.
These scripts shall execute all the code we need.

The scripts exist so that we have some sort of version control with Web3 being injected into [carrd.co](carrd.co).
